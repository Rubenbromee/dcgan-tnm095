# Implementation and evaluation of a DCGAN

In this project I implemented a deep convolutional generative adversarial network and compared the quality of its output when training epochs, dataset and loss functions were varied. It was very interesting to learn more about neural networks and exciting to create my own which also generated a very tangible output in the form of images! This project was done as a part of the course TNM095 Artificial Intelligence for Interactive Media. More information can be found in the report under the resources folder.
